Setup in new home dir:

    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:gsf/dotfiles2.git
    git pull origin master
    git push -u origin master

When you pull, if any errors like the following occur, move those files
and pull again:

    Untracked working tree file '.bashrc' would be overwritten by merge.

Add the following to ~/.git/config for nicer status output:

    [status]
    	showUntrackedFiles = no
